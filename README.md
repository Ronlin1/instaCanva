- 
## Current Limitations
- Limited Command Handling: The bot currently supports a basic set of commands. More complex commands and functionalities will be added in future updates.
- Design Export Formats: Currently, only PDF export is supported. Support for additional formats will be considered.
- Scalability: The bot is optimized for basic use cases and may require further optimization to handle a large number of simultaneous users efficiently.
- Error Handling: Some edge cases and error scenarios are not fully covered. We are working on improving error handling and user feedback.
- User Interface: The user experience is limited to text-based interactions. Future updates will include more interactive elements.

## Future Integrations
- Enhanced Design Functionalities: Integration of more Canva features such as template customization, text editing, and image manipulation directly via WhatsApp.

- Advanced Natural Language Processing : Integration of more advanced NLP features for better understanding and response to user queries.
- Integration with Other Platforms: Future plans include integrating with other popular platforms and services to enhance functionality and user experience.
- Analytics and Reporting: Adding features for tracking and analyzing bot interactions and user activities to improve performance and user satisfaction.

## Active Development
InstaCanva is an actively developing project. We are continuously working on enhancing its features, improving performance, and addressing user feedback. Stay tuned for regular updates and new features!

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the bot.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests.
- **Twilio**: For handling WhatsApp messages.
- **SendGrid**: For sending emails.
- **IBM Watsonx  AI**: For natural language processing.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   IBM_API_KEY=<your-genai-api-key>
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your-sendgrid-api-key>
   SENDGRID_MAIL=<your-sendgrid-email>
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<your-twilio-account-sid>
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-twilio-auth-token>
   TWILIO_PHONE_NO=<your-twilio-phone-number>
   RECIPIENT_MAIL=<recipient-email-for-notifications>
   RECIPIENT_NO=<recipient-whatsapp-number-for-notifications>
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The bot will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Endpoints

### Index Route

- **URL**: `/`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Redirects the user to the Canva OAuth2 authorization page.

### Callback Route

- **URL**: `/callback`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Handles the OAuth2 callback, exchanges the authorization code for an access token, and provides a link to WhatsApp for further interaction.

### WhatsApp Route

- **URL**: `/whatsapp`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Handles incoming WhatsApp messages, processes commands, and responds accordingly.

## Functionality

### OAuth2 Authentication

The bot uses OAuth2 to authenticate users with Canva. It generates an authorization URL and exchanges the authorization code for an access token.

### Upload Asset

Users can upload assets (images, etc.) to Canva, and the bot will notify a designated recipient via email upon successful upload.

### Create Design

Users can create new Canva designs by providing a title. The bot interacts with Canvaâ€™s API to create the design and confirms the creation to the user.

### List Designs

The bot allows users to search and list their Canva designs based on input keywords. It can also export designs to PDF and send them via WhatsApp.

### Natural Language Processing

IBM Watsonx  AI is used to handle natural language input from users, providing appropriate responses and assistance based on the user's request.

## Logging

Logging is configured to provide information and error messages. Logs are output to the console and can be adjusted in the `logging.basicConfig` configuration.
